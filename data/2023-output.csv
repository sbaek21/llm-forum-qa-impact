"By doing ```5000 * index```, you're effectively adding a delay to each ```setTimeout``` call. The first item will have a delay of 0 seconds, the second item will have a delay of 5 seconds, the third item will have a delay of 10 seconds, and so on. This ensures that each ```setTimeout``` is delayed by a different amount of time, so the ```Date``` is updated for each file. Without this, all the ```setTimeout``` calls would be delayed by the same amount of time, and they would all use the same initial timestamp.",100
"Found out that there is a method deadLetter(), that could send message to the deadletter ,  the argument type should be 'ServiceBusReceivedMessage' but manually converting message to ServiceBusReceivedMessage is not possible since the constructors are private.&#xA;The only way to achieve it as per my knowledge is to send the message to the queue and then receive the message from the queue so that the message will be of type ServiceBusReceivedMessage and then use the deadLetter() and send it to the deadLetter(which is a very clumsy method.",0

I believe that will only happen when building/debugging... when published those files are just copied over to the wwwroot folder on the server.  You'll notice that your local build release/debug &quot;bin&quot; folder does not show the static files.  I think they're in a &quot;.cache&quot; file in the &quot;obj&quot; folder.

"Another way to think of it: An awk script is made up of `condition { action }` statements. If you  write `awk 'foo'` with no explicit action then that's equivalent to writing `foo { print }` and the default action, `print`, is executed if `foo` evaluates to true. So, if `print` is the `action` then what is `foo`? It's a condition as that's the only other possibility and it's being tested for a true/false result as conditions always are.",63
