@JDsmith Did it work out for you?,0
I got it. thank you guys. but what about the variable? i have no idea regarding these variables which are declared in the functions,0

"Yes, the second answer does that because it was setup to deal with integers not floats",0
Have you tried to add new button to menu like this: `document.querySelector('[role=&quot;menu&quot;]');` - this should select your `settings menu` and then add your `theme button` to it?,0
"As a side comment, if sort[] has 5 elements, then those are numbered 0 through 4, and you should return sort[4]. I agree this function is pure C, with C++ you should use std::array or std::vector. If all you want is the 5th element, you don't need to sort the array, you can call std::nth_element. If you need the maximum (5th of five), you can find it with a single loop over the elements.",0
What do you mean by &quot;change event&quot;? Can't you just handle the `Unchecked` and `Checked` events?,0
It means you can't connect to your mongo server. You'll need to provide more details about where that server is and how it can be accessed.,0
"If you have do use structs, your workaround is the solution, otherwise as Olivier explained, use a class instead. Also mutable struct should be avoided (to avoid issues like yours).",0
"Hi, thanks for the solutions. I am interested in the third block of code wherein there is single data frame and need to process through several raster layers. Executing it results in an error AttributeError: Can't get attribute 'poly2' on &lt;module '__main__' (built-in)&gt;. Can you suggest a solution?",0
"In gradient descent, the error value should decrease as you update the parameters by subtracting a fraction (called the learning rate) of the gradient from its current value. If the error is increasing instead, this could be due to the learning rate being too large, getting stuck in a local minimum or saddle point, or other issues such as overfitting or insufficient training data. Try using a smaller learning rate, a different optimization algorithm, regularization, or more training examples to resolve these issues.",0
"I am unsure if you can code or not, but using **transient** cache is a better solution to handle slow query issues.",100
"@PeterJankuliak I edited the answer. If most usages are the same type, you can have one blanket implementation for all cases where it's the same type. And I don't understand how you got HKT here, it is not related at all.",0
"Why are you trying to pass `int` to `folgenlied`? And note that you will only ever get 0, -1, 1, or an error since `x` is an `int`.",0
"@puppydrum64: `loop` is more efficient on 8086 because it's smaller and not artificially slow.  https://www2.math.uni-wuppertal.de/~fpf/Uebungen/GdR-SS02/opcode_i.html.  See [Increasing Efficiency of binary -&gt; gray code for 8086](https://stackoverflow.com/q/67400133) re: optimizing for 8086 and 8088 where memory access (including code-fetch) is the primary bottleneck for those CPUs without cache and slow narrow busses, especially 8088.",0
"I'd run the original query with the PATINDEX call itself added as a column in the FROM clause, and the data that appeared were all positive integers. That's why I tried the nested query, figuring that the outer query would see only the rows returned by the inner query.",0
"Also, you should really use `iter` and `next` instead of `.__iter__` and `.__next__` directly. In the end, this really just means that your `each` is an alias for `__iter__`. I would just properly implement the [iterator interface](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Iterator) instead of using Ruby conventions. The two don't appear to be equivalent anyway since Ruby's version takes a function/block/whatever they're called.",0

"Anyway, looks like signed vs. unsigned median times are within some noise level of each other, as expected.",0
"What happens if you scale everything down to remotely uploading just one, file which is already on your server? For example, let's call the file `myvid.mp4`. Let's assume that the file is already on your server. Can you upload it to Vimeo with your current PHP code?",0
"You're welcome. Doing `char arr[] = &quot;blah&quot;;` is [effectively] coded as: `char arr[5]; strcpy(arr,&quot;blah&quot;);` for function scoped variables.",0
"Well now you're providing a forward declarations (for something you really shouldn't) and then trying to define an instance of it when only a declaration and no definition is available. The compiler error even tells you this. This is why you need to include the appropriate header so you have the definition available for use. You really should take a step back and get a better handle on what a declaration is and what a definition is and why the latter is needed here. Again I must ask, *why* do you *think* you *need* this?",0
I tried both commands (I tried running before running the other one) and the problem persists,0
Another note: While the OP hasn't shown their `memcpy` implementation it is currently not relevant because it is failing in setting up the parameters to call `memcpy`.,0
"the parameter y is equal to &quot;count1&quot; or &quot;count2&quot; which is defined outside the function. So my problem is still there, because the first time I press &quot;plus&quot; the new input is called AAA-1 but after the second click, the next input's id is still AAA-1 (instead of AAA-2). I've edited my snippet so It's easier to understand the problem.",0
This doesn't explain why `queue.Queue()` failed in your first example. Did you have an empty `queue.py`? Did something change between these runs of the code?,0
And also for the output to be exactly the same the condition &lt; in the for loop should be &lt;=,0
