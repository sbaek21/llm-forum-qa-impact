If the error is increasing instead, this could be due to the learning rate being too large, getting stuck in a local minimum or saddle point, or other issues such as overfitting or insufficient training data. Try using a smaller learning rate, a different optimization algorithm, regularization, or more training examples to resolve these issues."
