Thanks for your thoughts. (1) wrt sphinx -- I am OK with how it manages caches. Might be possible to terminate/flush/swap since I rarely run massive parallel queries on these indexes. I usually query manually or thru single threads. (2) I am very ambivalent wrt MyISAM vs InnoDB. My use cases (zero transaction/tons of inserts/fast BU/small footprint) favor MyISAM is most cases. I use InnoDB to parallel query partitions and on tables that require massive updates. (3) totally agree with your guidance. A bit more agressive (60GB for the pool + 68G SWAP).
