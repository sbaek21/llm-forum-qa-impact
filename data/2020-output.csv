Thanks for your thoughts. (1) wrt sphinx -- I am OK with how it manages caches. Might be possible to terminate/flush/swap since I rarely run massive parallel queries on these indexes.

I use InnoDB to parallel query partitions and on tables that require massive updates. (3) totally agree with your guidance. A bit more agressive (60GB for the pool + 68G SWAP).
